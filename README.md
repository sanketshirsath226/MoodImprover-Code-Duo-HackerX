# MoodImprover - Code Duo HackerX Hackathon

## MoodImprover

MoodImprover is a project developed by Code Duo for the HackerX Hackathon. The aim of the project is to improve users' moods by providing them with personalized music recommendations based on their current emotional state. The project combines an Android Studio frontend with a PHP backend and integrates the Spotify API for music recommendations.

## Features
Mood Detection: The MoodImprover app uses various techniques, such as sentiment analysis or user input, to detect the user's current emotional state.
Music Recommendations: Based on the user's detected mood, the app leverages the Spotify API to fetch personalized music recommendations.
User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and save their preferences and favorite songs for a personalized music experience.
Playlist Creation: The app allows users to create custom playlists based on their mood or music preferences.
Social Sharing: Users can share their favorite songs or playlists on social media platforms directly from the app.
